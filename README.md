# Turkish SMS Spam Detection with LSTM

This project implements a Turkish SMS spam classifier using an LSTM-based neural network.  
The goal is to automatically detect whether a given SMS is spam or ham.

## Features
- Used a public Turkish SMS dataset.
- Preprocesses text: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
- Labels: `0` = Ham (Normal), `1` = Spam
- Deep learning with LSTM for sequence modeling
- Evaluation with accuracy score

## Features
- Uses a public or custom Turkish SMS dataset
- Preprocesses text: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
- Labels: `0` = Ham (Normal), `1` = Spam
- Deep learning with LSTM for sequence modeling
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
